# Cub3D - Parsing Mode

## Current Status: PARSING ONLY MODE 🚀

This version of Cub3D has been configured to focus **only on parsing** while the engine development is being handled by your peer.

## What's Been Done ✅

### 1. **Main Function (`src/main.c`)**
- ✅ Commented out all engine initialization calls
- ✅ Commented out MLX game loop
- ✅ Commented out engine cleanup
- ✅ Keeps only parsing and validation
- ✅ Shows clear parsing summary

### 2. **Makefile**
- ✅ Commented out engine source files compilation
- ✅ Commented out MLX42 and GLFW library dependencies
- ✅ Simplified compilation to parsing files only
- ✅ No external graphics dependencies needed

### 3. **Header File (`inc/cub3d.h`)**
- ✅ Commented out MLX42 includes
- ✅ Commented out engine-related structures
- ✅ Commented out engine function prototypes
- ✅ Kept all parsing-related definitions

### 4. **Data Structure**
- ✅ Commented out MLX-related fields
- ✅ Commented out engine-specific fields
- ✅ Kept all parsing and validation fields

## What Works 🎯

- ✅ **Complete file parsing** (textures, colors, map)
- ✅ **Full map validation** (walls, player position, flood fill)
- ✅ **Error handling** for invalid files
- ✅ **Detailed parsing summary** with emojis
- ✅ **Memory management** and cleanup
- ✅ **All test files** (valid and invalid)

## Testing 🧪

```bash
# Compile (no MLX42 dependencies needed)
make

# Test valid maps
./cub3D maps/valid/map1.cub
./cub3D maps/valid/simple_valid.cub

# Test invalid maps (should show errors)
./cub3D maps/invalid/map_missing.cub
./cub3D maps/invalid/duplicate_texture.cub
```

## How to Restore Engine Mode 🔧

When your peer is ready to work on the engine, uncomment these sections:

### 1. **Main Function (`src/main.c`)**
```c
// Uncomment this section in main.c:
/* ===== ENGINE SECTION (COMMENTED OUT FOR PARSING PHASE) =====
 * TODO: Uncomment when peer starts working on the engine
```

### 2. **Makefile**
```makefile
# Uncomment these lines in Makefile:
# ===== ENGINE SOURCE FILES (COMMENTED OUT FOR PARSING PHASE) =====
# ===== MLX42 & GLFW LIBRARIES (COMMENTED OUT FOR PARSING PHASE) =====
```

### 3. **Header File (`inc/cub3d.h`)**
```c
// Uncomment these sections:
/* ===== ENGINE INCLUDES (COMMENTED OUT FOR PARSING PHASE) =====
/* ===== ENGINE STRUCTURES (COMMENTED OUT FOR PARSING PHASE) =====
/* ===== ENGINE FUNCTION PROTOTYPES (COMMENTED OUT FOR PARSING PHASE) =====
```

### 4. **Data Structure**
```c
// Uncomment MLX and engine fields in t_data structure
```

## Benefits of This Approach 💡

1. **🚀 Fast Development**: Focus 100% on parsing without engine distractions
2. **🔧 No Dependencies**: No need for MLX42/GLFW installation
3. **✅ Complete Testing**: All parsing features can be thoroughly tested
4. **🤝 Clean Separation**: Clear boundaries between parsing and engine work
5. **📝 Easy Integration**: Detailed comments for easy restoration

## Current Parsing Features 🎯

- **File Extension Validation**: `.cub` files only
- **Texture Path Parsing**: `NO`, `SO`, `WE`, `EA`
- **Color Parsing**: `F` (floor), `C` (ceiling) with RGB validation
- **Map Validation**: 
  - Valid characters (`0`, `1`, `N`, `S`, `E`, `W`)
  - Single player detection
  - Wall enclosure validation
  - Flood fill algorithm
  - Empty line detection
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup on success/failure
- **Error Handling**: Detailed error messages
- **Detailed Logging**: Visual parsing progress with emojis

## Next Steps 📋

1. ✅ **Parsing Complete** - Ready for peer integration
2. 🔄 **Await Engine Development** - Your peer can start working
3. 🔧 **Future Integration** - Uncomment engine sections when ready
4. 🎮 **Full Game** - Combine parsing + engine for complete Cub3D

**Happy Parsing! 🎉**

*Ready for 3D engine integration when your peer is ready!*
